This project demonstrates the working of a Three Phase Inverter supplied from an Impedance Source Inverter (ZSI). The ZSI boosts the DC input voltage with the help of shoot through in order to match the AC grid requirements. The LCL filters helps to smoothening the AC waveforms and provide a better output while connecting to the grid. The THD of the AC output is at 1.9 %.
